# library_database

# Overview

I used SQL in mySQL Workbench to create a database for a simple library system. This system allows you to keep track of books and accounts at the library. It contains how many copies there are for each book and allows accounts to check them in and out of the library system. You can create new queries to update the database with new or updated information.

# Relational Database

{Describe the relational database you are using.}

I used mySQL workbench to populate my library schema with tables and information.

I used 8 tables with various different types of relationships (one to many, many to many, one to one, etc.).

# Development Environment

I used mySQL workbench and figma to develop my database.

I used SQL to preform all tasks.

# Future Work

- I want to make sure you can't check a book out if there are already the max numbers of copies checked out.
- I would like to add it so that an account can be locked by not returning a book.
- Adding due dates to the checkout table would be a great addition.
